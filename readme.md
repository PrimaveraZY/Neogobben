This is the neogob set of neomoji by [@PrimaveraZY](https://sakurajima.social/@PrimaveraZY). It's a set of goblin emoji inspired by Volpeon's [Neocat and NeoFox](https://volpeon.ink/emojis/) emojis.

To use these, ask your instance admin to import or upload [this zip file](https://github.com/PrimaveraZY/neogobbo/src/neogob.zip) from the root directory. It contains the emoji.json and pack.json files designed for Sharkey-like and Akkoma-like instances respectively.

## Neogob
The Neogob folder contains PNG versions of the emoji, mostly created by Primavera.

## SVG
Source files created by [James](https://kitty.social/@o76923) after the neogob set was created for working on their additions.
